StarkCord Documentation
What is StarkCord?
StarkCord is a decentralized platform that revolutionizes project funding and collaboration by implementing a milestone-based investment system on StarkNet. It solves the traditional problems of project funding by ensuring:

Project funds are released only when milestones are achieved
Investors' funds are protected until deliverables are verified
Transparent progress tracking through blockchain technology

Key Features

Milestone-Based Funding: Instead of receiving all funds upfront, projects receive funding in stages as they complete predefined milestones
Validator System: Independent validators verify milestone completion before funds are released
Secure Investment: Funds are held in smart contracts until milestone requirements are met
Native Token (STRC): Used for investments and rewards within the ecosystem
